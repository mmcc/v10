/**
 * Per-request bidirectional-stream lifecycle (moq-transport draft-20 §3.3).
 *
 * The control model is request-stream based: each request (SUBSCRIBE, FETCH, TRACK_STATUS, …) opens its own
 * bidirectional stream, the first message on it is the request, and responses (SUBSCRIBE_OK / REQUEST_OK /
 * REQUEST_ERROR / PUBLISH_DONE / GOAWAY) arrive as control messages on the same stream. There is no UNSUBSCRIBE message
 * — cancellation IS the stream lifecycle: abort our sending direction (RESET_STREAM) and cancel the receiving direction
 * (STOP_SENDING), per §3.3.3.
 *
 * Callback-shaped, no signals — the session driver binds this to its own bookkeeping; SPF actors bind signals at the
 * `playback/` layer.
