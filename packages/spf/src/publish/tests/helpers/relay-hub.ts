/**
 * In-memory MoQ relay hub for cross-engine tests: real publish engine on one side, real playback engine(s) on the
 * other, draft-20 bytes in the middle over `createTransportPair` transports.
 *
 * Publisher side (`connectPublisher`) mirrors moq-relay 0.14.14's announce-and-serve ingest. After the SETUP exchange
 * the hub opens a bidi stream and solicits announces (SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, empty prefix, odd server-side request ids)
 * and reads NAMESPACE / NAMESPACE_DONE entries off that stream for the session's lifetime. Tracks are pulled on demand:
 * one upstream SUBSCRIBE per track (downstream demand dedupes onto it), with the publisher's SUBSCRIBE_OK assigning the
 * alias its subgroup data streams carry. A proactive PUBLISH is answered with REQUEST_ERROR 400 "PUBLISH is not
 * supported" exactly like the real relay, so a regression to the old ingest model fails loudly. The publisher ends a
 * track by FINing the hub's SUBSCRIBE stream — no PUBLISH_DONE ever arrives — and retracts a namespace with
 * NAMESPACE_DONE; both land in `trackEnds`, the churn signal the source-switch regression tests assert on.
 *
 * Subscriber side (`connectSubscriber`): answers SUBSCRIBE with SUBSCRIBE_OK (carrying LARGEST_OBJECT once the track
 * has content) and forwards objects one-per-subgroup-stream, resolving the request's Location Filter (draft-20 §5.1.2)
 * the way moq-relay 0.14.14 does — `relative-group 1` replays the current group from object 0 then follows live
 * (catalog joins), `relative-group 0` forwards only groups that start after the subscribe (video joins), and
 * `next-object` is strict: nothing already published is replayed (audio joins). FETCH is answered with REQUEST_ERROR;
 * the draft-20 player never sends one. A downstream subscribe registers standing upstream demand for its track; an
 * upstream FIN ends the track's downstream subscriptions with PUBLISH_DONE, the way a real relay ends the track for
 * every viewer.
 *
 * Tracks and demand persist across publisher sessions (a reconnecting publisher is re-solicited and its demanded tracks
 * re-subscribed), so the hub can also observe teardown/reconnect churn instead of crashing on it.
