/**
 * Publish-capable MOQT session (moq-transport draft-20), the publish-side sibling of `network/moqt/session.ts`'s
 * subscribe-only driver.
 *
 * Owns the protocol mechanics over an established transport: the SETUP exchange on paired unidirectional control
 * streams (§3.3), and the announce-and-serve ingest flow — answering the peer's SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE solicitation with
 * REQUEST_OK and a NAMESPACE entry for the announced namespace (§10.18–19), then serving the per-track SUBSCRIBEs the
 * peer routes back (answered with SUBSCRIBE_OK carrying a publisher-assigned track alias, §10.8) for as long as each
 * subscription's request stream stays open.
 *
 * Flow choice: the publisher initiates no request streams at all. moq-relay 0.14.7 removed PUBLISH-based ingest
 * (upstream `de336492`: every PUBLISH is answered with a request error), and it solicits namespaces itself — one
 * SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE per authorized prefix, sent immediately after SETUP. Announcing rides the solicitation stream as
 * NAMESPACE entries (suffix-relative, parameterless — the relay treats even an empty parameter count as malformed);
 * data flows only on aliases bound by our own SUBSCRIBE_OKs, per subscription. Three hard-won peer constraints shape
 * the teardown paths: a subscription ends by FIN alone (any byte after SUBSCRIBE_OK — a PUBLISH_DONE, say — makes the
 * relay abort the track for every viewer instead of finishing it), a client-sent GOAWAY closes the whole session (code
 * 17), and a track alias bound to two live request IDs closes it too (code 12) — so aliases are the peer's own request
 * IDs, unique by construction.
 *
 * Deliberately callback-shaped with NO signals, mirroring the subscribe driver — signal awareness enters at the
 * `publish/` behavior layer through the actor below. Lives in `publish/` rather than `network/moqt` so the parent-owned
 * wire layer keeps only additive sibling files.
